The goal of `react` is to help with reactivity, instead of calling the `foo`
reactive expression `foo()` you can call `react$foo` similar to how one 
calls `input$bar` for inputs. 

The benefit is that it makes it easier to identify calls to reactive expressions
in your server code. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of react from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
pak::pak("tadascience/react")
```
