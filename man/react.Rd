\title{Reactivity helper}
\usage{
react(x)
}
\description{
The \code{react} object gives alternative syntax to call
shiny reactive expressions.
}
\details{
The benefit is that it makes them easier to spot in your code.
}
\examples{
# This works by invoking the function from the parent environment
# with no arguments ...
foo <- function() {
  42
}
react$foo
react[foo]
react[foo()]

# You can also use `react()` as a function to wrap the
# reactive call
react(foo())

# The benefit is that `react()` can also wrap `input$` calls
# so that you easily recognize reactivity

\dontrun{
  # ... but it only becomes relevant when used in shiny
  # server code, e.g. this app from the shiny page
  # with react$dataInput instead of dataInput()
  server <- function(input, output) {

    dataInput <- reactive({
      getSymbols(input$symb, src = "yahoo",
          from = input$dates[1],
            to = input$dates[2],
            auto.assign = FALSE)
    })

    output$plot <- renderPlot({
       chartSeries(react$dataInput, theme = chartTheme("white"),
              type = "line", log.scale = input$log, TA = NULL)
    })
  }
